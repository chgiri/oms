# OMS — Order Management System

A domain-driven order management backend built with Spring Boot: customers,
products, inventory, orders, payments, and shipments, connected by an
event-driven saga instead of direct service-to-service calls.

## Features

- **Domain modules** — `auth`, `customer`, `product`, `inventory`, `order`,
  `payment`, `shipment`, each with its own controller/service/repository/DTO
  layers.
- **Event-driven order flow** — a transactional outbox publishes `OrderCreated`
  events to Kafka; independent consumers reserve inventory, advance the order
  saga (`AWAITING_PAYMENT` / `CANCELLED`), and auto-create shipments once an
  order is confirmed. See [`docs/process-roles.md`](docs/process-roles.md).
- **Independently scalable web/worker roles** — the same image runs as an
  API-only `web` process or a consumer-only `worker` process via
  `APP_PROCESS_ROLE`, so an HTTP traffic spike and a Kafka backlog scale
  separately instead of forcing you to add replicas of one do-everything
  process.
- **JWT auth (RS256)** — asymmetric signing with a public JWKS endpoint
  (`/.well-known/jwks.json`), so a future independent service can verify
  tokens without ever holding the signing key.
- **Distributed locking & rate limiting** — Redisson-backed locks around
  concurrent inventory updates, and Bucket4j-backed login rate limiting, both
  correct across multiple app instances.
- **HashiCorp Vault** — secrets (DB/Redis passwords, JWT keys, admin
  password) are resolved from Vault rather than passed as plain env vars in
  uat/prod (Kubernetes auth) and, optionally, in local dev too. See
  [`vault/README.md`](vault/README.md).
- **Observability** — Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, and
  Loki/Promtail log aggregation, provisioned out of the box locally and via
  Kubernetes manifests for a real cluster.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- JDK 21 (only if running outside Docker, e.g. from an IDE)

### Run everything locally

```bash
cp env.example .env
# edit .env — at minimum set DB_PASSWORD, REDIS_PASSWORD, DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD
docker compose up --build
```

This starts Postgres, Kafka, Redis, a dev-mode Vault (seeded automatically),
the app (`web` + `worker` roles), Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki/Promtail.

- API: http://localhost:8080
- Swagger UI: http://localhost:8080/docs
- Actuator (health/info/prometheus): http://localhost:8081/actuator
- Grafana: http://localhost:3000 (`admin` / value of `GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD`)
- Prometheus: http://localhost:9090

### Running from an IDE

Set `DB_HOST`/`REDIS_HOST`/`KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS` to `localhost` (the
defaults already assume this) and run the infra-only services:

```bash
docker compose up postgres kafka redis
```

Vault is optional for local/IDE work — see [`vault/README.md`](vault/README.md)
if you want to exercise that path too.

### Default admin account

A user is seeded on first startup if none exist yet, using
`DEFAULT_ADMIN_USERNAME` / `DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD`. Change the password
after first login.

## API

Every domain exposes a standard REST CRUD surface plus search/filter
endpoints. Explore it via:

- **Swagger UI** at `/docs` (disabled in `prod`)
- **Bruno collections** in [`bruno/`](bruno) — import the folder into
  [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/) for ready-made requests against every
  endpoint, including auth, advanced search, and status-update flows.

## Configuration

Environment profiles: `dev` (default), `test`, `uat`, `prod` — see
`src/main/resources/application-{profile}.properties`. Required variables
per environment are documented in [`env.example`](env.example); `uat`/`prod`
fail fast at startup if a required secret or config value isn't supplied
(no silent insecure defaults).

## Testing

```bash
./mvnw test
```

Integration tests use Testcontainers (Postgres, Kafka) and don't require any
profile or external services beyond Docker.

## Deployment

- **Docker Compose** — see above; also runs the full monitoring stack.
- **Kubernetes** — manifests in [`k8s/`](k8s), managed via Kustomize. Covers
  web/worker Deployments, HPA (web) and KEDA `ScaledObject` (worker),
  PodDisruptionBudget, Ingress, and Grafana/Prometheus/Loki wiring. See
  [`k8s/README.md`](k8s/README.md) for cluster prerequisites and the
  one-time Vault setup in [`vault/README.md`](vault/README.md).

## Monitoring

See [`monitoring/README.md`](monitoring/README.md) for the Prometheus/Grafana/
Loki setup and the pre-built OMS Overview dashboard.

## Project structure

```

Each domain module follows the same layout: `controller/`, `service/`
(+ `service/impl/`), `repository/`, `entity/`, `dto/`, `mapper/`,
`specification/` (for dynamic search filters), and `exception/`.
